# Traffic-Flow-Optimization
Vehicular observation, bottleneck detection and simulation.

Problem statement - Detecting any bottlenecks like parking /encroachment of road & footpath / road condition  in vicinity of a junction which result in congestion and reduce the traffic flow. 

Project Summary
The integration of advanced technologies such as drones and deep learning models, particularly through the utilization of YOLO models, opencv and genetic algorithm is transforming urban traffic management, as highlighted by the synthesis of the reviewed research. These technologies enable real-time traffic monitoring, adaptive traffic signal control, and precise vehicle detection, thereby significantly improving traffic flow, reducing congestion, and enhancing road safety. Despite challenges such as limited drone battery life and inconsistencies in vehicle detection accuracy under different operational conditions, continuous technological advancements and regulatory developments offer promising solutions to address these issues. Future research should focus on enhancing the scalability and adaptability of these technologies in diverse urban environments. Key areas of emphasis should include refining detection algorithms, expanding drone capabilities, and augmenting datasets for more effective algorithm training. By addressing these areas, the potential for creating highly efficient, intelligent, and safer urban traffic management systems is immense, ultimately contributing to improved urban living conditions and environmental sustainability.
